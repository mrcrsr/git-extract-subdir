# The EOL settings in this file do NOT modify the EOLs of the working tree.
# But change the EOLs in the staging area and the index.
#
# To normalize EOLs of files, that where commited prior to this file run
#     git add --renormalize .
#     git status
#     git commit -m "Normalized EOLs of all tracked files accordingly to .gitattributes"
# to update all tracked files in the repo.
#
# To verify that the files in the repo are using the correct EOLs run
#     git ls-files --eol
# i:      Line endings in Git's index               Should be lf
# w:      Line endings in the working tree          Should be lf or crlf
# attr:   Attribute applied to the file
#
# PATTERN   text       -> Converts EOL to LF inside repo and to system's native EOL on checkout
# PATTERN   text=lf    -> Converts EOL to LF inside repo and stays LF on checkout
# PATTERN   text=crlf  -> Converts EOL to LF inside repo and to CRLF on checkout
# PATTERN   binary     -> Does in no way manipulate EOLs


# Match all files for EOL normalization, that are not ignored
